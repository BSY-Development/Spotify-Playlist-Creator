# Spotify-Playlist-Creator
This application creates a top 100 of most played songs from a chosen year. You need to provide an user ID and Secret which you can get at the spotify website. What I used: Spotipy and Beautiful Soup. Beautiful Soup to scrape a page and get all songs and Spotipy to make a playlist into spotify.
